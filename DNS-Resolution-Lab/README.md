Lab: Observe DNS Resolution

Project Objective
 The purpose of this lab was to observe the Domain Name System (DNS) in action. I used command-line tools to observe the
 conversion of a URL to an IP address and performed DNS lookups to identify web and mail servers for specific domains.

Key Concepts & Tools
 DNS Conversion: Observed how URLs like www.icann.org are translated into IP addresses for network routing.
 nslookup Utility: Used this command-line tool to query DNS name servers and retrieve resource record information.
 Mail Server Identification: Used specific nslookup modes to identify Mail Exchanger (MX) records for domains like cisco.com.

Practical Observations
 Identified the IPv4 address for www.icann.org through ICMP ping tests.
 Successfully used nslookup to find the IP addresses associated with www.google.com.
 Observed how DNS allows humans to use readable names instead of numeric IP addresses, acting as a "phonebook" for the internet.
